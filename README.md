GBeta Virtual machine with a Train Algorithm incremental Garbage Collector. Masters Thesis product implemented by Peer Møller Ilsøe and Simon Hem Pedersen 

FILES:
~~~~~~

gbvm/conf.mk      : Included in all sub makefiles and contains all the
                    options available for compilation with make

gbvm/bin          : contains precompiled executables for i586 Linux and sparc solaris

gbvm/testoutput   : contains most of the output from our experiments

gbvm/testresults  : the data files passed to gnuplot and the generated graphs

gbvm/runtests1.pl : Perl script used for conducting the space
                    utilization and time performance tests with
                    both train creation policies.

gbvm/runtests2.pl : Perl script used for conducting speed comparison and write
                    barrier quantification.

gbvm/src/nodist   : Example gbeta bytecode files (not guaranteed to work)

gbvm/src/gc_new   : The major part of the source code for the new garbage
                    collector implementation

gbvm/src/gc       : The major part of the source code for the old garbage
                    collector implementation (not entirely bug-free :))

gbvm/src/gc_common: The common parts shared between the old and the new garbage
                    collector implementation

gbvm/src/vm       : The virtual machine component source code

gbvm/src/allocator: Memory manager not capable of gc, not used anymore

gbvm/doc          : Html browsable version of the source code (generated by global-4.0.1)
                    Unfortunately header files are not visible

BUILDING EXECUTABLES:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
example:

cd gbvm
make depend
make clean
make DEBUG=n OPTIMIZE=9 SETVMREF=m -j

This leaves the executable src/vm/gbvm

(Do not rely on makefile dependencies)

EXECUTION EXAMPLE (SPARC):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
bin/gbvm_sparc_nodebug_16_16 src/nodist/gbeta_programs/cruncher3.gbc
